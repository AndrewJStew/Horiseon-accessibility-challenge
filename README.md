# Horiseon Accessibility Challenge

## Task Description

The aim of this task was to reformat the code found in the original index.html and style.css file for the Horiseo website and make it more accessible.

By following standard semantic HTML coding practice and organising the CSS in a way which is easier to navigate, the code has been transformed. 

The motivation behind accomplishing this task was to make the website easier to access for people with a range of disablities. This includes those using screen readers.

By undertaking this task I have learnt the core principles of semantic HTML and also how to better orginase and comment on code for those using it at a later date.
